1. Navigate to the Sign In page by clicking "Sign up" at the top right of the landing page.
2. You can choose one of the two options to create your account: </br>
    a. You can easily sign up using your Google account, eliminating the need for any additional steps. (If the system was configured enabling this option) </br>
    b. Simply fill out the required fields and activate your account through the email sent by Emissary.

<code> ℹ️ If you participated in an event related to the platform, use the **same registered email address**.</code>

Now you have your new Emissary account!

## Connecting a Wallet

To create transfer requests and receive your tokens you will need first to set up your wallet on Emissary. To do it, complete the steps on [Connecting a Wallet](../guide/connecting-a-wallet.md).

3. Hit the “Create New Request button”; </br>
