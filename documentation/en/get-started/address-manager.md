# Address Manager

# Overview

This guide is your go-to resource for getting started with our system. As an address manager, you'll find step-by-step instructions on key actions to kickstart your experience.

## Accessing default addresses

The address manager has access to all the users’ wallets in the system, along with their last updated time. This support role is typically used in conjunction with other roles.

To access the users’ address information, navigate to the “User Address” section. Here, you can see the wallets and download them in CSV if necessary.
